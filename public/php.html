       <h2>12) What is "echo" in PHP?</h2>
       <p>PHP echo outputs one or more strings. It is a language construct, not a function, so the use of parentheses is not required. But if you want to pass more than one parameter to echo, the use of parentheses is required.</p>
       <p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
       <pre>void echo ( string $arg1 [, string $... ] )</pre>
       <p><strong>More details...</strong></p>
   
       <h2>13) What is "print" in PHP?</h2>
       <p>PHP print outputs a string. It is a language construct, not a function, so the use of parentheses is not required with the argument list. Unlike echo, it always returns 1.</p>
       <p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
       <pre>int print ( string $arg )</pre>
       <p><strong>More details...</strong></p>
   
       <h2>14) What is the difference between "echo" and "print" in PHP?</h2>
       <p>1. Echo can output one or more strings, but print can only output one string and always returns 1.</p>
       <p>2. Echo is faster than print because it does not return any value.</p>
   
       <h2>15) How is a variable declared in PHP?</h2>
       <p>A PHP variable is the name of the memory location that holds data. It is temporary storage.</p>

       <h2>1) What is Laravel?</h2>
       <p>Laravel is a free to use, open-source web framework based on PHP. It was developed by Taylor Otwell and supports the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern. Laravel provides an expressive and elegant syntax, making it easy and quick to create wonderful web applications. The first version of Laravel was released on 9th June 2011.</p>
       <p>As of the SitePoint survey in March 2015, Laravel was voted as one of the most popular PHP frameworks along with Symfony, Nette, CodeIgniter, and Yii2.</p>
   
       <h2>2) What are the main features of Laravel?</h2>
       <p>Some of the main features of Laravel are:</p>
       <ul>
           <li>Eloquent ORM</li>
           <li>Query builder</li>
           <li>Reverse Routing</li>
           <li>Restful Controllers</li>
           <li>Migrations</li>
           <li>Database Seeding</li>
           <li>Unit Testing</li>
           <li>Homestead</li>
       </ul>
   
       <h2>3) What do you understand by Eloquent ORM?</h2>
       <p>Eloquent ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is one of the main features of the Laravel framework. It is an advanced PHP implementation of the active record pattern.</p>
       <p>Active record pattern is an architectural pattern found in software, responsible for keeping in-memory object data in relational databases.</p>
       <p>Eloquent ORM represents database tables as classes, with their object instances tied to single table rows, while following the active record pattern.</p>
   
       <h2>4) What is Query Builder in Laravel?</h2>
       <p>Laravel's Query Builder provides more direct access to the database, as an alternative to the Eloquent ORM. It allows building queries programmatically without the need to write SQL queries directly. Additionally, it supports specific caching of the results of executed queries.</p>
   
       <h2>5) Write down the name of some aggregates methods provided by Laravel's query builder.</h2>
       <p>Some of the methods that Query Builder provides are:</p>
       <ul>
           <li>count()</li>
           <li>max()</li>
           <li>min()</li>
           <li>avg()</li>
           <li>sum()</li>
       </ul>
       <h2>6) What is routing?</h2>
       <p>All Laravel routes are defined in route files, which are stored in the routes directory. These files are loaded by the MVC framework. The routes/web.php files define routes that are available for the web interface. Those routes are allotted as the web middleware group, which provide features such as session state and CSRF protection. The routes available in routes/api.php are stateless and are allotted as the API middleware group. For most of the applications, one should start by defining routes in routes/web.php file.</p>
   
       <h2>7) What do you understand by Reverse routing?</h2>
       <p>Reverse routing in Laravel is used to generate the URL based on name or symbol. It defines a relationship between the links and Laravel routes, and it is possible to make later changes to the routes to be automatically propagated into relevant links. When the links are generated using names of existing routes, the appropriate uniform resource identifiers (URIs) are automatically generated by Laravel. Reverse routing provides flexibility to the application and helps the developer to write cleaner codes.</p>
       <p>Route Declaration:</p>
       <code>Route::get('login', 'users@login');</code>
       <p>A link can be created to it using reverse routing, which can be further transferred in any parameter that we have defined. If optional parameters are not supplied, they are removed automatically from the generated links.</p>
       <code>{{ HTML::link_to_action('users@login') }}</code>
       <p>By using it, a URL like <a href="https://abc.go.com/login">https://abc.go.com/login</a> will be created automatically.</p>
   
       <h2>8) How will you describe Bundles in Laravel?</h2>
       <p>In Laravel, Bundles are also known as Packages. Packages are the primary way to add more functionality to Laravel. Packages can be anything, from a great way to work with dates like Carbon, or an entire BDD testing framework like Behat. Laravel also provides support for creating custom packages.</p>
       <p>There are different types of packages. Some of them are stand-alone packages. This means they can work with any PHP framework. The frameworks like Carbon and Behat are examples of stand-alone packages. Other packages are intended for use with Laravel. These packages may contain routes, controllers, views, and configurations which are mainly designed to enhance a Laravel application.</p>
   
       <h2>9) What is a composer, and how can we install Laravel using composer?</h2>
       <p>A composer is a dependency manager in PHP. It manages the dependencies required for a project, pulling in all the necessary libraries and dependencies in one place.</p>
       <p>Laravel Installation Steps:</p>
       <ol>
           <li>If you don't have composer on your system, download composer from <a href="https://getcomposer.org/download/">https://getcomposer.org/download/</a></li>
           <li>Open command prompt</li>
           <li>Go to the htdocs folder</li>
           <li>Run the following command under C:\xampp\htdocs></li>
       </ol>
   
       <h2>10) Does Laravel support caching?</h2>
       <p>Yes, Laravel provides support for popular caching backends like Memcached and Redis.</p>
       <p>By default, Laravel is configured to use the file cache driver, which stores the serialized or cached objects in the file system. For huge projects, it is suggested to use Memcached or Redis.</p>
   
       <h2>11) How to clear cache in Laravel?</h2>
       <p>The syntax to clear cache in Laravel is given below:</p>
       <code>php artisan cache:clear</code>
       <code>php artisan config:clear</code>
       <code>php artisan route:clear</code>
       <h2>12) How will you explain middleware in Laravel?</h2>
       <p>As the name suggests, middleware works as a middleman between request and response. Middleware is a form of HTTP requests filtering mechanism. For example, Laravel consists of middleware which verifies whether the user of the application is authenticated or not. If a user is authenticated and trying to access the dashboard then, the middleware will redirect that user to the home page; otherwise, a user will be redirected to the login page.</p>
       <p>There are two types of middleware available in Laravel:</p>
       <ul>
           <li><strong>Global Middleware:</strong> It will run on every HTTP request of the application.</li>
           <li><strong>Route Middleware:</strong> It will be assigned to a specific route.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Syntax:</p>
       <code>php artisan make:middleware MiddlewareName</code>
       <p>Example:</p>
       <code>php artisan make:middleware UserMiddleware</code>
       <p>Now, UserMiddleware.php file will be created in app/Http/Middleware.</p>
   
       <h2>13) What do you understand by database migrations in Laravel? How can we use it?</h2>
       <p>Migrations can be defined as version control for the database, which allows us to modify and share the application's database schema easily. Migrations are commonly paired with Laravel's schema builder to build the application's database schema easily.</p>
       <p>A migration file includes two methods, up() and down(). A method up() is used to add new tables, columns, or indexes to the database and the down() method is used to reverse the operations performed by the up() method.</p>
       <p>We can generate a migration and its file by using the make:migration command.</p>
       <p>Syntax:</p>
       <code>php artisan make:migration blog</code>
       <p>By using it, a current date blog.php file will be created in database/migrations.</p>
   
       <h2>14) What do you know about Service providers in Laravel?</h2>
       <p>Service providers can be defined as the central place to configure the entire Laravel applications. Applications, as well as Laravel's core services, are bootstrapped via service providers. These are powerful tools for maintaining class dependencies and performing dependency injection. Service providers also instruct Laravel to bind various components into Laravel's Service Container.</p>
       <p>Most service providers extend the Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider class. Most service providers contain the following functions in their file:</p>
       <ul>
           <li>Register() Function</li>
           <li>Boot() Function</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Within the Register() method, one should only bind things into the service container. One should never attempt to register any event listeners, routes, or any other piece of functionality within the Register() method.</p>
   
       <h2>15) How can we get data between two dates using Query in Laravel?</h2>
       <p>We can use the whereBetween() method to retrieve the data between two dates with Query.</p>
       <p>Example:</p>
       <code>Blog::whereBetween('created_at', [$date1, $date2])->get();</code>
   
       <h2>16) What do you know about CSRF token in Laravel? How can someone turn off CSRF protection for a specific route?</h2>
       <p>CSRF protection stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery protection. CSRF detects unauthorized attacks on web applications by unauthorized users of a system. The built-in CSRF plug-in is used to create CSRF tokens so that it can verify all the operations and requests sent by an active authenticated user.</p>
       <p>To turn off CSRF protection for a specific route, we can add that specific URL or Route in the $except variable which is present in the app\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken.php file.</p>
       <p>Example:</p>
       <code>class VerifyCsrfToken extends BaseVerifier {<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;protected $except = [<br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Pass here your URL',<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;];<br>
       }</code>
       
    <h2>17) List some official packages provided by Laravel?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cashier: Laravel Cashier implements an expressive, fluent interface to Stripe's and Braintree's subscription billing services.</li>
        <li>Envoy: Laravel Envoy provides a clean, minimal syntax for defining frequent tasks that we run on our remote servers.</li>
        <li>Passport: Laravel Passport provides a full OAuth2 server implementation for Laravel applications to create API authentication.</li>
        <li>Scout: Laravel Scout provides a driver-based solution for adding full-text search to Eloquent models.</li>
        <li>Socialite: Laravel Socialite provides an expressive, fluent interface to OAuth authentication with various social platforms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>18) What do you understand by Unit testing?</h2>
    <p>Unit testing is built-in testing provided as an integral part of Laravel. It consists of unit tests which detect and prevent regressions in the framework. Unit tests can be run through the available artisan command-line utility.</p>

    <h2>19) What do you know about Facades in Laravel? Explain.</h2>
    <p>Laravel Facades provide static-like interface classes which are available in the application's service container. Laravel self-ships with several available facades, gives access to almost all features of Laravel. Facades also help to access a service directly from the container itself. It is described in the Illuminate\Support\Facades namespace. Hence, it is easy to use.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <code>use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache;<br>
    Route::get('/cache', function () {<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;return Cache::get('PutkeyNameHere');<br>
    })</code>

    <h2>20) How can we check the Laravel current version?</h2>
    <p>One can easily check the current version of Laravel installation using the -version option of the artisan command.</p>
    <p><code>php artisan --version</code></p>
